    "### Overview of the data\n",
    "The data was gathered through an online platform via a survey where respondents remained anonymous. Its objective is to gauge obesity levels among individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, spanning ages 14 to 65. This dataset will be utilized to train a model using the 'train.csv' file and subsequently applied for predictions using the 'test.csv' file. Due to the nature of its collection method, there may be inaccuracies present; nevertheless, it serves as valuable material for training and prediction model development.\n",
    "#### Purpose of the data\n",
    "The dataset comprises 17 attributes that concentrate on various aspects related to obesity. These attributes represent commonly recognized factors associated with obesity. The dataset was gathered to analyze several actions concerning the outcomes of obesity. By utilizing this dataset, we can construct models to predict the likelihood of obesity based on individuals' daily habits. Ultimately, this predictive capability can assist people in avoiding unhealthy behaviors. Alternatively, it can aid in the development of mechanical interventions or the creation of novel treatment methods.\n",
    "#### Prediction for data\n",
    "By prediction the data, we can identify the key factors that directly influence obesity. Moreover, we can analyze behavioral data to assess the likelihood of obesity.\n",
    "#### Who may benefit from this report?\n",
    "Every people who care about their health and daily habits should be interested on this model and report. Since it reveal the relationship between the obesity and daily behavior.\n",
    "#### How well would your prediction algorithm need to perform useful to these third parties?\n",
    "The model aims to identify the factors influencing obesity and determine their impact. It will provide precise estimations of how specific variables contribute to obesity. To ensure accuracy, the model will be evaluated using test datasets, as the data source encompasses an entire survey.\n",
